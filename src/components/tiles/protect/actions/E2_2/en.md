## Further Development of Municipal Funding Programs

Municipal funding programs are an effective tool to create investment incentives for citizens. Three ongoing programs in Karlsruhe:

- **KlimaBonus Karlsruhe** (formerly Bonus Program)*
- Modernization measures in redevelopment areas (limited to energy-related measures)
- **Refrigerator Replacement Program** **

The goal is to increase the renovation rate (building envelopes and energy carrier transitions) and contribute to the targeted expansion of photovoltaic capacity by 2030.
