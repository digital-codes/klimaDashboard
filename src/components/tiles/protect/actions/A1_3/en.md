## Sustainability-Oriented Product Design of the Stadtwerke

The Stadtwerke Karlsruhe aim to align their electricity and gas product portfolio more closely with sustainability. The goal is to significantly increase the share of green electricity and green gas. By 2030, 60,000 customers are expected to use NaturStrom (green electricity) and 20,000 customers NaturGas (green gas). This corresponds to an increase of 125 GWh/year in green electricity and 230 GWh/year in green gas.
