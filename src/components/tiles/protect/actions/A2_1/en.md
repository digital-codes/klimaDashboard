## Further Expansion and Densification of the District Heating Network

District heating is particularly low in CO2 emissions due to its high share of industrial waste heat and combined heat and power (CHP) generation. The goal is to connect 5,000 apartments between 2020 and 2025 and another 5,000 apartments by 2030 (increasing the total from 45,000 to 50,000), along with non-residential buildings located along the network route. This includes 200 to 300 new connections, primarily for larger multi-story residential buildings.
